### 1. **Install Prerequisites** (one-time)

Download and install:
- **0-SCore mod** from Nexus Mods (must match game version)
- **0-NPCCore mod** from Nexus Mods
- **Ollama** from ollama.com (installs as Windows service)
- **Python 3.9+** from python.org (check "Add to PATH")

### 2. **Download Your Mod**

Download `NPCLLMChat-v1.0.0.zip`

### 3. **Extract to Mods Folder**

Unzip to:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\
```

Result:
```
Mods\
  ├── 0-SCore\
  ├── 0-NPCCore\
  └── NPCLLMChat\  ← New folder created by unzip
```

### 4. **Run Setup (One Time)**

Open Command Prompt:
```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\NPCLLMChat"
setup_servers.bat
```

Installs voice dependencies (~2-3 min)

### 5. **Download AI Model**

In Command Prompt:
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

Downloads AI model (~2-3 GB, few minutes)

### 6. **Play!**

Launch 7 Days to Die normally. Find an NPC and:
- Type: `@Hello!`
- Or hold **V** key and speak

**That's it!** The mod auto-starts everything.

Note: If you have a slow computer it is possible that the mod will timeout
      waiting for one of the servers (piper, whisper, ollama).
      Restarting the game from scratch may help.

**User skill required: Can extract a zip file and run a .bat file**
